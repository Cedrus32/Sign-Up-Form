# sign-up-form

Created Through The Odin Project.

This was my first time working with client-side form validation. I used several validation methods, including built-in (browser) type-based validation, pattern validation with regular expressions, and custom validation messages.

One of the biggest challenges in this project was handling the logic to check validity for input fields that were "tied" to others, such as the "Phone Number" and "Password/Confirm Password" fields.

Another challenge was learning regular expressions (coming from no prior experience) to create robust pattern validation without excluding otherwise valid user input, particularly with names and email addresses.

Note: I realize this form is by no means secure and ready to be implemented on a client website. Rather, this project served as an exercise in the theory and practice of form validation.
